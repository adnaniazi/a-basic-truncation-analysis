2. State model distribution and state speed distribution.
	Mine all data
	record for each state all occurring measurements (as raw data points (not means) and normalised raw data)
	record for each state all occurring lengths to next move
	plot “length to next move” for each state as a violin plot for the three different treatments

Strategy:
=========
# do it for the minimum number of reads of all three datasets:

Returns
- a data structure for raw data per state,
- a data structure for for pA normalized raw data per state,
- a data structure for normalized data per state,
- data structure for stay length per state
